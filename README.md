# Example-Change of Basis-PCA
> In this segment, we'll take a look at how we compute the transformation matrix M that helps us navigate between multiple basis vectors. We'll generalise the conventions on how to move from one basis to another basis so that it becomes easier while using the formula.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

We will be using PCA techniques for Change of Basis.

- What is the background of your project?

In this segment, we'll take a look at how we compute the transformation matrix M that helps us navigate between multiple basis vectors. We'll generalise the conventions on how to move from one basis to another basis so that it becomes easier while using the formula.
